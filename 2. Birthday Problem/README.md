# Birthday Problem
In probability theory, the birthday problem asks for the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share the same birthday. The birthday paradox is the counterintuitive fact that only 23 people are needed for that probability to exceed 50%[^1].

## Summary
- This project simulates the birthday problem using a class of N students. It prints the number of shared birthdays, the
students who share this birthday, and the day itself. The results show how the probability increases as the number of people in the room increase.

## TODO
- [ ] Refactor code
