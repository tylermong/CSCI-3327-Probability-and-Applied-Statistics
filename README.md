# Probability and Applied Statistics Projects
A collection of Java projects focused on probability and statistical concepts.

## Projects
### 1. Standard Deviation Calculator
Computes sample and population standard deviation from a set of values and outputs the results to the console.

### 2. Statistics Library
A library implementing various statistical methods including:
- Mean.
- Median.
- Mode.
- Population/Sample Standard Deviation.

### 3. Set Operations
Implements fundamental set operations including:
- Union.
- Intersection.
- Complement.

### 4. Monty Hall Problem Simulation
Simulates the Monty Hall problem, demonstrating counterintuitive probability concepts through simulation.

### 5. Birthday Problem Simulation
Simulates the birthday probability problem, calculating the probability of shared birthdays in a group of N people.

### 6. Combination and Permutation Solver
Implements calculations for:
- Permutations (nPr).
- Combinations (nCr).
- Factorial operations (helper method for nPr and nCr).

### 7. Pokemon Mulligan Probability Simulation
Computes the probability of a deck resulting in a mulligan for the initial hand, for each number of Pokemon in the deck (0 to 60), by simulating drawing the hand N times.
