# Probability and Applied Statistics Projects
A collection of Java projects focused on probability and statistical concepts.

## Projects
### 1. Standard Deviation Calculator
Computes sample and population standard deviation from a set of values and outputs the results to the console.

### 2. Statistics Library
A library implementing various statistical methods including:
- Mean.
- Median.
- Mode.
- Population/Sample Standard Deviation.

### 3. Set Operations
Implements fundamental set operations including:
- Union.
- Intersection.
- Complement.

### 4. Pokemon Battler
A simple console-based Pokémon battle simulator where two Pokémon battle against each other until one faints. It includes:
- A basic battle loop.
- Speed comparison to determine turn order.
- Attacking mechanics.

### 5. Monty Hall Problem Simulation
Simulates the Monty Hall problem, demonstrating counterintuitive probability concepts through simulation.

### 6. Birthday Problem Simulation
Simulates the birthday probability problem, calculating the probability of shared birthdays in a group of N people.

### 7. Combination and Permutation Solver
Implements calculations for:
- Permutations (nPr).
- Combinations (nCr).
- Factorial operations (helper method for nPr and nCr).

### 8. Pokémon Mulligan Probability Simulation
Computes the probability of a deck resulting in a mulligan for the initial hand, for each number of Pokemon in the deck (0 to 60), by simulating drawing the hand N times.

### 9. Pokémon Trading Card Game Emulation
Emulates a simplified version of the Pokémon Trading Card Game (base set), allowing for basic gameplay mechanics and interactions.
Project documentation is available in the `docs` folder, and can also be viewed online at [TCG Docs](https://tcgdocs.tylermong.dev/).
- Simulates drawing cards, playing Pokémon, and using abilities.
- Includes a basic game loop and player interactions.

### 10. Pokémon Rare Candy Brick Probability Simulation
Computes the probability of a deck resulting in a Rare Candy brick, for each number of Rare Candies in the deck (1 to 4), by simulating the initial game state N times.
