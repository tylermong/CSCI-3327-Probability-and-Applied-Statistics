# Set Operations
In mathematics, a set is a collection of different things; these things are called elements or members of the set and are typically mathematical objects of any kind: numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or even other sets. A set may be finite or infinite, depending whether the number of its elements is finite or not. There is a unique set with no elements, called the empty set; a set with a single element is a singleton.[^1]

## Summary
This project demonstrates set operations by implementing union, intersection, and complement functions. These functions are applied to integer, floating point, and string sets, with the results printed to the console.

## TODO
- [ ] Refactor code to improve time complexity.
