# Pokemon Rare Candy Brick Probability Simulation
In this scenario, the rare candies are bricked when all N of them are found within the prize pile. When this occurs, the player is not able to play any of these cards, therefore "bricking" them.

## Summary
The project computes the probability of a player's deck resulting in a Rare Candy brick, for each number of Rare Candy in the deck (from 1/4 to 4/4). It runs this simulation N times (specified in the Main class) allowing for a more accurate probability. The results for each deck configuration are printed to the console.
