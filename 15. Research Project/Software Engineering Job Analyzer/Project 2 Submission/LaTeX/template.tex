		\noindent This paper analyzes 199 software engineering internship listings to identify the most in-demand technical skills. Python, C++, and Java were the most frequently mentioned skills, appearing in 38\%, 24\%, and 21\% of listings, respectively. The data follows a right-skewed distribution, indicating that a small number of skills are dominant. Furthermore, these dominant skills are typically widely adopted and stable technologies, rather than newer, trendier ones. This analysis has several limitations, particularly the small sample size, and future improvements could include increasing the sample size and integrating a machine learning model for more advanced analysis.

\section{Introduction}

The software engineering job market continues to be in a highly competitive state, especially for those trying to break into tech by applying to new graduate and internship roles. Companies are increasingly seeking interns who possess strong technical abilities and can demonstrate their skills through live technical interviews. Additionally, with waves of layoffs and the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, the average computer science student is facing increased pressure to stand out in a crowded field. As such, it is essential for students to understand which skills are most in demand in order to remain competitive when applying to internship roles.

This study explores the skills required in software engineering internship positions by analyzing approximately 200 internship listings scraped from various job boards. The listings represent a wide range of companies, from big tech companies to smaller startups, providing a broad perspective on current industry expectations. The primary objective of this analysis is to identify the most in-demand technical skills across software engineering internships.

Through this research, statistical methods taught throughout the CSCI-3327 Probability and Applied Statistics course at Stockton University are applied to a series of sample problems, and the results are analyzed. 

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data Collection}

Internship listings were scraped using a Java-based script with the \textit{jsoup}\footnote{\textit{jsoup}: the Java HTML parser, built for HTML editing, cleaning, scraping, and XSS safety. Available at: \url{https://jsoup.org/}.} library, which is built to parse webpage data. The data collection process was carried out as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Link Scraping}: Internship listing links were scraped from two GitHub repositories: Summer 2025 Tech Internships by Pitt CSC \& Simplify, and Summer 2025 Tech Internships by Vansh \& Ouckah. These repositories provided collections of links to internship listings hosted on various platforms.
    \item \textbf{Duplicate Link Filtering}: Duplicate links were removed from the dataset to ensure each internship listing was only included once.
    \item \textbf{Platform Link Filtering}: The remaining links were further filtered to include only those hosted on the Workday, Greenhouse, and Lever job platforms. Although the dataset spans 2,173 links across 436 different job boards, the three aforementioned platforms together account for approximately 28\% of all links, despite representing only 0.69\% of the total number of job boards.
    \item \textbf{Data Scraping}: After filtering, the remaining internship listings were scraped for key information, including company name, job title, location, skills, and listing URL. Skills were extracted by identifying technical keywords\footnote{A full list of keywords can be found in: \url{src/main/java/dev/tylermong/jobanalyzer/util/SkillKeywords.java}}, such as programming languages, frameworks, and tools, mentioned in the job description. Skills were standardized to be case-insensitive to group together the same skills with different capitalizations.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
The processed data was analyzed using a Java-based approach, where each skill keyword was stored as a key in a map, with the corresponding frequency of occurrences as the value. These key-value pairs were then written to a file for easy viewing. This simple frequency analysis lays the foundation for potential further statistical exploration, such as identifying trends or comparing skill frequencies across different internship listings.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Top 10 most frequent skills across 199 internship listings.}
    \label{tab:skills_frequency}
\end{table}

As shown in the Table \ref{tab:skills_frequency}, Python leads as the most popular skill, appearing in 38\% of internship listings, followed by C++ and Java at 24\% and 21\% respectively. The median skill frequency occurrence is 1\%, with the mean being 2.9\%. This disparity indicates a heavily right-skewed distribution, where a small set of highly demanded skills dominates the market, and the majority of skills form a long tail of lower demand.

\section{Discussion}

The analysis of software engineering internship postings provided relevant data regarding the current skills desired by employers. Python occurred the most frequently, appearing in 38\% of listings. This is a significant jump from the second most popular skill, C++, which appeared in 24\% of listings. Its rise in popularity is likely due to Python excelling in many areas, such as data science, machine learning, and web development, paired with its low learning curve. \\

The right-skewed distribution also provides important insight into skills, highlighting that there is a small set of highly demanded skills, such as those provided in Table 1, which dominate the market. While some technologies may be popular in developer circles due to their cutting-edge features, it is clear that the job market prefers technologies with wide adoption and long-term stability. \\

While this analysis provides a good starting point in uncovering broader skill trends, there are several limitations to the data that should be addressed. \\

To start, the 199 listings that the data is extracted from are a relatively small sample size when compared to the number of active internship and job listings. There are two main methods to remedy this. First, adding support for platforms other than Workday, Greenhouse, and Lever, and second, adding support for additional link scraping, so as not to be limited by the current two repositories. \\

Next, extending the analysis to include other data points, such as location, company sector, and company size, could allow for additional and more accurate insights. Along with this, exploring how trends shift over time would also be valuable. \\

Finally, with this additional data, adding a machine learning model to discover deeper patterns, such as skill clustering (e.g., Python, data science, and machine learning appearing together) or projecting current trends into the future, would add a further layer of insight into the data. A machine learning model could also be implemented in order to scrape skills and other keywords more effectively. Currently the description of each listing is scanned word-by-word, looking for matches against the VALID\_SKILLS, from the SkillKeywords class. While the list is extensive and the scraping is relatively effective, the methodology is primitive and requires manual updating to add new skills.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Conclusion}

This analysis highlights the most in-demand technical skills found in software engineering internship listings, with Python, C++, and Java at the forefront. The data suggests that companies widely favor widely adopted, stable, and long-standing technologies over newer, trend-driven ones. While the findings offer useful insights, they are limited by several factors, such as a limited sample size.
