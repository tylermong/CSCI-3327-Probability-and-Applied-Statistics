# Combination / Permutation

Permutation and Combination are the most fundamental concepts in mathematics related to picking items from a group or set.

* Permutation is arranging items considering order of selection from a certain group.
* Combination is selecting items without considering order.[^1]

## Summary
This project demonstrates set operations by implementing union, intersection, and complement functions. These functions are applied to integer, floating point, and string sets, with the results printed to the console.

## TODO
- [x] Improve comments to enhance clarity.
