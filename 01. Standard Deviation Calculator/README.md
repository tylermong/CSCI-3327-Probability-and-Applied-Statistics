# Standard Deviation Calculator
In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation of the values of a variable about its mean.[1] A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. [^1]

Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. [^2]

## Summary
This project implements a calculator for both sample and population standard deviation. Given a set of numbers, it computes and outputs both types of standard deviations to the console.

## TODO
- [ ] Refactor code into separate classes and methods.
